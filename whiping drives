Filling the disk with all zeros (This may take a while, as it is making every bit of data 0)
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1M *replace X with the target drive letter.

If you are wiping your hard drive for security, you should populate it with random data rather than zeros (This is going to take even longer than the first example.) :
dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdX bs=1M *replace X with the target drive letter.
