1. First install windows to drive then install all drives and applications and run all updates
2. When OS is fully updated go to "Disk Managment" and shink data partition in half
3. Install Linux onto the drive via the available partition then update/finish the system
4. When you reboot Windows should show in the GRUB



If CentOS 7 wont see Windows in grub do this
cd /etc/grub.d/
nano 40_custom

  put this in at the end
menuentry "Windows 10" {
         set root=(hd0,1)
         chainloader +1
         }
  
  run this and then you are done
grub2-mkconfig --output=/boot/grub2/grub.cfg

Making a partitions available on both windows and ubuntu
mkdir ntfs_mount

mount /dev/sda1 /ntfs_mount_test

Turned of hibernation in Windows so that Windows would completely release the drive to allow Ubuntu to mount it and write to it.
Turned off fast boot in Windows because the Ubuntu drive mount errors noted to also turn off fast boot.
I put a mount entry in /etc/fstab on Ubuntu to mount the 65TB shared storage to /ntfs_mount
Installed storcli on Ubuntu so the drive array could be viewed from Ubuntu.
