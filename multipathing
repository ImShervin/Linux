The pools can be tricky. Here is a multpathd cheat sheet. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND IT IS VERY BASIC.  This will not apply to all cases but would get multipathing installed on a system.  Also, this is specific to red Hat derivatives.
 
 
        Install and load multipathd
 
yum install and load multipathd
[root@localhost ~]# yum list installed |grep multip
device-mapper-multipath.x86_64              0.4.9-127.el7              @base   
device-mapper-multipath-libs.x86_64         0.4.9-127.el7              @base 
 
   rpm -qa |grep device
        You need   "device-mapper-multipath"   package
     which mpathconf
     mpathconf --enable --with_multipathd y
     modprobe dm-multipath  <--------------- Load kernel modules
     modprobe dm-round-robin
     lsmod |grep multi
     multipath -ll
     mpathconf <----------- show me status of multipathd
 
 
This assumes that it has been cabled correctly. If you don't see two path
in the multipath command then its not cabled correctly.
 
This also assumes we are using the default /etc/multipatd.conf files
with freindly names
 
Proper output:
 
 
# multipath -ll
